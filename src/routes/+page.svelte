      I'm currently the course instructor of <a

        >595G, Seminar in Computer Security</a

      at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Previously, I was a founding
      member and blockchain security auditor at
      <a class="link" href="https://osec.io">OtterSec</a>
      and a quantitative researcher at

      I'd like to explore as much computer science and pure mathematics as I
      can. Embedded systems, where programmers have creative freedom over
      hardware, software, and the bridge between the two, are my favorite.
