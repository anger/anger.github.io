This weekend, the US Cyber Team played in the Global Cyber Game's New Year
Mayhem. With all the challenges that were outside my comfort zone (ah, crypto,
my beloved), I thought it'd be informative to review the hardest web in the CTF!

chat it is with great misfortune i cannot write up the challenges (the interpol
and other government agencies have their guns pointed at my windows). such is
the state of hackthebox challenge reuse :(
